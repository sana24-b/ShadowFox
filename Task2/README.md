# Task 2 - Boston House Pirce Prediction
A Machine Learning Regression Project: 

This project focuses on predicting Boston house prices using a regression model trained on a classic housing dataset. The goal is to understand how different features (crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, etc.) influence housing prices and build an accurate predictive model.

# Project Overview
This task involves:

 - Loading and understanding the dataset
 - Handling missing value
 - Separating features and target
 - Splitting the dataset into training & testing sets
 - Training a Linear Regression model
 - Evaluating the model using R², MAE, and RMSE
 - Visualizing actual vs predicted prices

All steps are implemented in the file : taskAI_ML.ipynb 

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes features such as:

CRIM — Crime rate per capita
ZN — Proportion of large residential lots
INDUS — Non-retail business area proportion
CHAS — Charles River dummy variable
NOX — Nitric oxide concentration
RM — Average number of rooms
AGE — Age of buildings
DIS — Distance to employment centers
RAD — Highway accessibility
TAX — Property tax rate
PTRATIO — Student–teacher ratio
LSTAT — Lower status population %
MEDV — Target: Median house price

# Model Used :
Linear Regression
A simple and effective baseline model for predicting continuous values.

# Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using:

R² Score — Measures how well the model fits the data
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) — Average absolute error
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) — Measures prediction error magnitude

# Visualizations

Actual vs Predicted Plot : 
Distribution of housing prices (optional)
These help visualize model performance and prediction accuracy.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a simple Linear Regression model can be used to predict housing prices based on multiple features. It covers essential ML steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
